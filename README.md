When light travels from one medium to another, it bends or refracts. The Snell's law calculator lets you explore this topic in detail and understand the principles of refraction. 

# Snell's law of refraction

Snell's law describes how exactly refraction works. When a light ray enters a different medium, its speed and the wavelength change. The ray bends either towards the normal of two media boundary (when its speed decreases) or away from it (when its speed increases). The angle of refraction depends on the indices of refraction of both media:
